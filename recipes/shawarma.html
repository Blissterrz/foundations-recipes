    <h1> Finest Arabic Chicken Shawarma Sandwich </h1>
    <p> <img src="./images/shawarma.jpg"> </p>
    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> Shawarma is a popular Levantine dish consisting of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in a cone-like shape, and roasted on a slowly-turning vertical rotisserie or spit. Originally made with lamb or mutton, it is now also made of chicken, turkey, beef, or veal.</p>
    <p> Although the roasting of meat on horizontal spits has an ancient history, the shawarma technique—grilling a vertical stack of meat slices and cutting it off as it cooks—first appeared in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, in what is now Turkey, in the form of doner kebab.</p>
